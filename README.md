# Personal-Projects by Iymen Abdella
Hello and welcome to my repo of personal projects. Some of these were inspired from ideas I had or jobs I have done.
The topics of these projects range from Cloud infrastructure automation to app development. 
All feedback and suggestions for improvement are always welcome. 

##Pokemon.zip (still in development)
* Inspired by the popular video game and the battle simulator: **Pokemon Showdown**
* Pokemon uses random number generation (RNG) along with player choice to determine wins and losses within the game. 
* The goal of this application is to create the best possible team based on the tiering system of the competitive pokemon.
* I use my understanding of probability and statistics to produce the best result.
* Developed using Java.

##SudokuGame.zip
* Inspired by the long standing newspaper game. More info about the rules can be found here: *https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku*
* I recall playing this game for many years growing up and decided to build an algorithm to create and solve these popular puzzles.
* I use my knowledge of combinatorics and mathematics to come up with a solution.
* The algorithm uses a reduction technique that involves
** Building a sudoku solution
** reducing the solution down as much as possible so that it is still solvable in an iterative process. 
* Developed using Java

##Image_Processing.zip
* Originally began as a class project and developed into a color tracker as well. 
* developed using python and the OpenCV Library (*https://opencv.org/*), this application highlights and tracks colors in a sample video. 
* OpenCV library and Python are required.
